# WinSCP PowerShell Wrapper

This is still a very very beta version, with limited functionality, i will be developing this extensively.  

currently there are only two functions
```PowerShell
New-WinSCPSession
Get-WinSCPFiles
```

I have included the WinSCPnet.dll in the _NeededAssemblies_ folder.

Check back for updates.
